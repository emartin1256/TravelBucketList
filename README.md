# Travel Bucket List

Using Django, SQLite, HTML and CSS, I have created a simple travel bucket-list app. Upon posting a destination to the list, a pin will appear on the map at the specified location. The "x" next to each destination can also be used to remove destinations and delete them from the database.

My app is hosted [here.](https://blueberry-crisp-07077.herokuapp.com/travel/)
